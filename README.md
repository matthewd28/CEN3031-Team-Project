# Chari-tables Contribution Tracker

### Overview

Chari-Tables is a tool we created to incentivize community involvement, whether that be through volunteering or donating to charitable (pun) organizations! This tool provides analytics for user donations/volunteering across years, and includes a contributions page to check up on all of the good work your friends have been doing/posting to the website!

### Installation / Use Instructions

*PREREQUISITE: Must have MySQL (or equivalent) installed
https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/

In the GitHub repository, click the green button that says “Code” and select “Download Zip.” Then, extract the files to a location of your choice. Once extracted, open a terminal in the directory “\Chari-Tables-main\client\charitables\” and another in “\Chari-Tables-main\server\.” In both terminals,  you will first need to run “npm install” to install the required dependencies. Once they are installed, enter “npm start” in both terminals to start both the server and client. React will automatically open in your web browser where you can explore the web application as you wish.
